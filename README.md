# BME230A - Introduction to Computational Genomics and Systems Biology
This was the capstone course of the Bioinformatics BSc degree. This course was a good learning expereince as to what being a bioinformatician looks like in a more fast paced environment. The final project in the course (not included in the repository per request of the advisor) proved to be my biggest personal challange in this course, particularly on what is expected in a good final project. Regardless - this course had numerous sucesses, my particular favorite being the effecient string series (mabdulqa/BME230A/ESC_Execises/) where we read papers on how to do string comparisons in an efficent manner - something super important in genomics - since genomes of interest are now the larger, more complex mammailian genomes. The course also went into more advanced topics of genome assembly like - alignments, seeding, and variations of DeBruijn and other assembly algorithms that could handle challenge regions of the genome like sequence repeats and variations. Phylogentics algorithms was also introduced in this course like UPGMA. There was also a brief introduction to linear and logistic regression, which I geniunely enjoyed especially since machine learning was heavily used in a lot students' final projects.
