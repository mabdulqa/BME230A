# BME230A - Introduction to Computational Genomics and Systems Biology
This was the capstone course of the Bioinformatics BSc degree. Unlike other courses - this was a more results oriented course, where effiecency and finding solutions was the target rather than learning skills. This course was a good learning expereince as to what bioinformatics looks like in larger orgs like the Genomics Institute and start ups. The drawback of the course in my opinon was the lack of direction the course tended to have - paritcularly in terms of the assignments. The final project in the course (not included in the repository per request of the advisor) proved to be the biggest source of confusion in terms of direction on what is expected in a good final project. Regardless - this course had numerous sucesses, my particular favorite being the effecient string series (mabdulqa/BME230A/ESC_Execises/) where we read papers on how to do string comparisons in an efficent manner - something super important in genomics - since genomes of interest are now the larger, more complex mammailian genomes. There was also a brief introduction to linear and logistic regression, which I geniunely enjoyed at first but realized - now with more experience in hand - it was not as thorough as it should have been as machine learning was heavily used in a lot students' final projects.
