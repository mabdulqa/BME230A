The following challenge is based upon the following paper:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24413527

I *strongly* recommend reading the paper through before attempting the 
challenge. Pretty much all the solutions are contained in there, in slightly
adapted form - it's your job to comprehend them and code them in Python.

Feedback very welcome!

Grading will be based on: 
(1) if your code works (see the unit-tests) 
(2) a cursory assessment of your code (e.g. structure, commenting, perceived elegance) and
(3) the asymptotic cost of your algorithms (you get the mark for each question if as good (or better) as in the paper referenced above),
(4) your answers to the questions, which can be provided inline within the code, and provide some description of how you arrived at your answer

I will award 25% of the grade for each category, I will give each individual question equal weight, e.g. Q 2 is worth the same as Q 3a.

To run the python unit-tests do the following:
(1) ensure both the unit-test file "challenge1UnitTest.py" and your implementation
"challenge1.py" are in the same directory. 
(2) In that directory run the python command: "python challenge1UnitTest.py". 

If your code is correct then the tests will all pass.
Please do not share your answers or copy other code. 
I will investigate any noted plagiarism!
